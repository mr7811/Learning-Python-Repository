#Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable:
#  a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

# a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
# y=[z for z in a if z % 2 ==0]
# print(y)
